Project: Stack of Integers using vector
Description:
This C++ program implements a stack using a vector. The stack performs the following operations:

Check if the stack is empty.
Push integer values onto the stack.
Pop the top element from the stack.
Get the top element of the stack.
Compute the average of all the elements in the stack.
How to Run the Code:
Prerequisites:
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
Steps to Compile and Run:
1) Save the code into a file named stack_operations.cpp.
2) Open a terminal or command prompt.
3) Navigate to the directory where stack_operations.cpp is saved.
4) Compile the program using the following command: g++ -o stack_operations stack_operations.cpp
5) Run the compiled program with the following command: ./stack_operations
